            <h3>How does the matching process work?</h3>
            <span class="arrow">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Our platform uses a sophisticated matching algorithm to connect senders and travelers. When you create a listing, our system searches for travelers who are heading to or from your specified destination. We consider factors such as travel dates, routes, and user ratings to ensure the best match.</p>
            <p>You will receive notifications about potential matches, and you can review traveler profiles or sender requests to choose the most suitable option for your needs. Once a match is confirmed, you can coordinate the details through our platform.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, security is a top priority for us. All transactions are protected by our escrow payment system. When you make a payment, the funds are held securely until the package is delivered and confirmed. This ensures that both parties are protected and that the transaction is fair.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we implement advanced encryption and security protocols to safeguard your personal and financial information throughout the entire process.</p>
